# ngbp (based on [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate)) 

An opinionated version of an opinionated [kickstarter](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate) for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects.

Fork with the following goals:
- Coffee script by default
- Change build systems from Grunt to Gulp (It's much faster, and more understandable for me. Code > Configuration)
- Include SASS and Bourbon / Neat / Bitters / some Refills

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/metermaid/ngbp
$ cd ngbp
$ sudo npm -g gulp karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gem install sass (assuming you have ruby and rubygems...)
$ gulp

```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/ngbp/build/index.html` in your browser.

Happy hacking!
