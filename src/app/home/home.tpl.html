<p>You are an alien spy preparing for your biggest assignment yet: infiltrating the planet Earth.</p>
<p>To prepare you for this mission, you must study the Earth's culture. The High Council of Spycraft has given you access to its greatest study aid: the website, Tumblr&reg;. Young Earthlings, they say, spend their time trading pictures of their genitals and reblogging pictures on Tumblr&reg;.</p>
<p><strong>Your mission: blend in with these tumbling Earthlings. Your test: to successfully recognize and report the common tag for each set of images.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correct answers will automatically be submitted. Incorrect answers will be ignored.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The test begins now.</strong></p>
